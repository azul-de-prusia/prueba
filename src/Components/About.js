                            <p>I am an art enthusiast, and I love all ways of drawing. I have developed as a self-taught illustrator since 
                                I can remember because of the great passion that drawing means to me. I have a large experience with traditional techniques
                                and I recently started learn digital media to be able to do animation since it is something that interests me a 
                                lot because of the wide possibilities it offers and cause I´m a big fan of cartoon series.</p>
                            <p>I consider myself as a very creative person with wide interests, I love art chemistry, history, philosophy, animals, anatomy, and trying
                                new ways to draw. 
                     </p>

                    <p> I would love to collaborate with a company that appreciates creative work as well as visual and audiovisual content.</p>
                        <p>I have a background as Profesional Restorer and Conservator, I´ve worked during 7 years as technical, researcher and work resident 
                            restorer in different places of Mexico. I got specialized in paper conservation.</p>
                            <p>At the same time that I worked as a restorer I always looked for engraving, I am a 3-time winning Madonnari artist and I have also participated 
                                in several painting competitions. Recently I started looking for spaces to exhibit my work and thus reach more people</p>
